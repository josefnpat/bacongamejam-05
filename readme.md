#Sis, Help Me!
##Bacon Game Jam 5

Theme: Lights Out

You wake up in your room, and your brother is missing!

Horrible voices tell you to collect his remains, from the 
depths of your closet, which has turned into a horrible
nightmare. You need to find him, before you wake up,
You wouldn't want to leave him in such a horrible state, would you?

Hints:

* Pay attention to cut scenes! She's trying to tell you something.
* You have been cast into a different dimension;
  The only way back, is through the door you came through.
* When your battery gets low, find somewhere to hide!
* You are constantly slowly waking up, and when you do, game over.
* Don't touch the monsters. Quite a fright.
