## Lights Out

Top-down zelda like game

You have a lantern, and have to recharge it by hitting space bar, but in that time, there is no light, and you can't move.

You are a slow child with a backpack.

You wake up in the night, and your sister is dragged off into the closet.

minimal 2 bit color

There are bad guys, and holes.

You are timed.

Plot twist: You're the sister?
Plot twist: You're the bad guy?

Rooms are randomly generated;
Each room has a: N,E,S,W (U,D, All directions?)
Rooms don't ever make sense

You just wander from room to room, but it's like simon says, and you have to remember how you got there.

If you leave through the south room, you have to return to the north room, otherwise you get an entirely different room. (Lack of spacial logic)

HP Lovecraft meets House of Leaves meets Chronicles of Narnia

Your goal is to find all the parts of your sister:

Head, Torso, Left Arm, Right Arm, Left Leg, Right Leg, and then finally you have to bring her back to your room.
